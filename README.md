# language-praat package

This package adds support for the PRAAT scripting language in Atom.
Both syntax highlighting and snippets are included.
The package also allows syntax highlighting in files with `noweb` syntax (text within the code chunk markes `<<*>>=` and `@` is highlighted according to PRAAT syntax, while text outside the code chunks is rendered as plain text).
